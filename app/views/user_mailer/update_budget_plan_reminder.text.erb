It's a monthly reminder to revise and update budget.

Do you know? Many take a look at their budget on a monthly basis, especially if they are attempting to pay off debt. The best time to do this is generally at the end of the month. Take a look at the previous monthâ€™s budget and determine how well it worked for you and your family. Adjust certain aspects of your budget as needed.
